Description: R and Armadillo integration using Rcpp
 Armadillo is a templated C++ linear algebra library (by Conrad Sanderson)
 that aims towards a good balance between speed and ease of use. Integer,
 floating point and complex numbers are supported, as well as a subset of
 trigonometric and statistics functions. Various matrix decompositions are
 provided through optional integration with LAPACK and ATLAS libraries.
 The RcppArmadillo package includes the header files from the templated
 Armadillo library. Thus users do not need to install Armadillo itself in
 order to use RcppArmadillo. Armadillo is licensed under the MPL 2.0, while
 RcppArmadillo (the Rcpp bindings/bridge to Armadillo) is licensed under the
 GNU GPL version 2 or later, as is the rest of Rcpp.
